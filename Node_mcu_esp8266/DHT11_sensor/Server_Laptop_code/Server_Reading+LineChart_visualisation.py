# A function that plots line chart of temperature and humidity readings with their respective timestamps.

      Purpose: to plot temperature & humidity vs timestamp readings

      parameters: time_stamp (where temperature & humidity was received ) - type String
                  heat_level (a single temperature reading value) - type float
                  humidity (a single humidity reading value) - type float
                  temp_que (a deque storing previous 10 temperature readings) - type deque [int]
                  humidity_que (a deque storing previous 10 humidyty readings) - type deque[int]
                  timestamp_que (a deque storing previous 10 time stamps where readings were captured) - type deque [String]

      Return: No value to be returned from this function

      Major operations: 1. placing heat_level, humidity, and time_stamp in temp_que, humidity_que, timestamp_que.
                        2. Order the deques chronologically, based on timestamp. 
                        3. plotting the figure with its axes
